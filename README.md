# React + TypeScript + Vite + Mui + Redux + Jest

This template provides some file configuration and boilerplate to use easily with react project.

Some basic configurations and settings which is considered in this template:

-   Redux store setup and provider settings.
-   Mui theme provider and dark theme settings.
-   React router dom provider with BrowserRouter.
-   Jest library alongside with react testing library, with "test" script.
-   Some basic file structure (feature based structure).

To use this template you can just clone the repository and change folder name with the "name" property in the "package.json" file in the root directory.

I hope this could reduce some basic work from users.
